I went Gandhi hospital for check up. I have arrived from Italy and I had fever symptoms and they did a test from my nose and found results to be negative but they did not do any blood tests and the fever is still there and I will go back and checked up again. #coronavirusinindia
Most doctors don't realize the latest updates from WHO where loss of smell & taste are even listed as prime symptoms. I had all the typical symptoms too but wasn't accepted by the top 3 clinics. While I'm glad that I tested -ve, the process needs to change. #CoronavirusIndia
